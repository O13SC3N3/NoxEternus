<p><font color="#cc66ff">Nox Eternus</font> uses a "darker" rendition on the FTB Infinity Modpack. Utilizing "Expert Mode" and unforgiving mods like; Deadly World, Special Mobs, Special AI, and Lycanites Mobs to name a few. It adds a more frustrating and tense experience to the Survival of You and Your Friends. Nox Eternus 1st and 2nd Editions has had its Private Server minions throwing their keyboards, cussing, and screaming all followed by timely Rage-Quits. We invite you to join our World, and leave dead like many before you. </p>
